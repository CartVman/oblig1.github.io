            <h1>About us</h1> 
                <p> We opened Nanacawa in 2021.
                    Here you can get the most equisite and outstanding japanese food in Oslo.
                    Nanacawa is owned by chef Nasiba, Nabila, Cart and Wardah.
                    Here we try to deliver quality food that taste just like the ones you get in japan. 
                    Our goal is to bring a bit of japan to Norway, 
                    so that the amazing japanese food can be enjoyed by all. 
                <p>

                <h1> Accessibility Report</h1>

                <p>Web accessibility is very important as it makes the content on a web site more 
                    user friendly and easy to understand for all visitors, especially those with 
                    disabilities and limitations. We have therefore had this as our main focus while 
                    creating this Restaurant page. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    First thing that instantly caches your eye, is the colour contrast. We decided 
                    to use a dark background with bright text to make the information stand out and 
                    easy to read. We have done so in the “home” page but did fail a little under the 
                    “menu” pages. We started off by having a light blue background there, but that 
                    created an error in the accessibility check. Therefore, we changed it to darker shade, 
                    to create a stronger contrast. The contrast we now have has a ratio of 4.24:1, 
                    which is very close to the standard contrast ratio of 4.5:1 that all websites 
                    should have. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another thing that we have put effort into is page structure content. We have very 
                    clearly labelled the different regions of the page on the top left corner, in a 
                    logical and efficient way. “Home” “about” “menu” and “contact” are our four regions, 
                    and each region has a very clear heading. We have done this to improve the navigation 
                    and orientation on the web page. We have furthermore also made the regions change 
                    background color and text color when you hover over them with a mouse. This had been 
                    done to make it easier for the visitor to find the information it needs. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    On one of the regions called “menu” there is submenu. This is shown when the visitor 
                    moved the mouse to hover over the parent item, in this case “menu”. The submenu 
                    is visible for as long as the visitors hovers over it. We did this to be able to 
                    place more links on the page, without it seeming cluttery. Another reason behind 
                    this design is to make the information more structure and easily accessible. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have also created a button that returns you to the top of the page, which makes 
                    browsing on the page easier. The visitor can get back to the point of where they 
                    started, and also our four regions are back in their sight if they wish to find 
                    some other information. Another button we have crated is seen on the home page only. 
                    This button is in a red colour, to make it stand out, and it says “see the menu”. 
                    The thought behind this button is to prioritise the main information. The menu is of 
                    our visitors main interest, and we wanted to make it the easiest to access.
